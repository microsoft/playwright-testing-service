# Microsoft Playwright Testing Preview

*Microsoft Playwright Testing* (aka *Playwright Service*) is a new managed service offering designed to extend Playwright's open-source library capabilities:

1) Speed up test execution with high parallelism across multiple browsers and OS platforms. [Click Here](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AnC03V99SiLFkGT9LnBxmGWzU8lt?e=SLZc19) to see the demo.
3) Troubleshoot test issues through easy access to stored, rich test metadata like logs, traces, and videos. (Coming soon)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The service is in early stages of development, so this private repository is being used for announcements, docs, issues, and discussions related to the Playwright Service private preview. **Please remember that all information here is Microsoft confidential and covered by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).**
