# Microsoft Playwright Testing Private preview

Microsoft Playwright Testing is a new service offering built for [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), a fast-growing open-source framework that enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps. Microsoft Playwright Testing is designed to help development teams speed up the delivery of features while ensuring high quality. The service provides users access to many cloud-hosted browsers, enabling them to run multiple Playwright tests in parallel and across various operating system-browser combinations. [See the demo.](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AnC03V99SiLFkGT9LnBxmGWzU8lt?e=SLZc19)
