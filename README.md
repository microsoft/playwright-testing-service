# Microsoft Playwright Testing private preview

Microsoft Playwright Testing service can speed up [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) test execution by increasing parallelism at cloud scale. The service is kept up-to-date with every new Playwright release, ensuring that you can run Playwright tests on a wide range of OS-browser combinations.

# How to start

> [!NOTE]
> We're still building the service and we understand that the process might still be a bit rough around the edges, or that some of the steps may be unfamiliar. Feel free to [reach out to us](https://aka.ms/mpt/feedback) if you encounter any challenges or have any questions.

## Confirm access to the private preview

While we're in private preview, you'll need to temporarily follow a few one-off steps in this guide: [Enable your Azure subscription for Microsoft Playwright Testing](./docs/onboard-subscription.md)

## Create a Workspace

1. Sign in to the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal) using your Azure account credentials. You may want to bookmark the website.

1. Create the Workspace.

    ![Create new workspace](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/assets/1908215/379dee60-52f9-4ae0-8915-c34816d3538a)

    |Field  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Workspace Name** | A unique name to identify your workspace.<BR>The name can't contain special characters or whitespace. |
    |**Azure Subscription** | Select an Azure subscription. If you don't see anything in the drop-down, you need to [onboard an Azure subscription to the private preview](./docs/onboard-subscription.md). |
    |**Region** | This is where test run data will be stored for your workspace. |

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you don't see this screen, select an existing workspace and go to the next section.

## Generate Access Token

1. In the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal), select **Generate token** to create the access token.

    ![Generate Access token](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/assets/4140290/1d133717-9433-476b-927c-d4ffa3ce48dd)

1. Copy the access token.

## Obtain region endpoint

> [!NOTE]
> This is a temporary step during the private preview.

1. In the [Playwright portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal), copy the command under **Add region endpoint in your set up**.

    ![Set workspace endpoint](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-testing-service/assets/1908215/1c095f72-a735-4aea-bdd1-d472afe80e84)

    The endpoint URL corresponds to the workspace region. You might see a different endpoint URL in the Playwright portal, depending on the region you selected when creating the workspace.

## Set up environment

Ensure that the `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL` that you obtained in previous steps are available in your environment.

We recommend using `dotenv` module to manage your environment. With `dotenv` you'll be using the `.env` file to define your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to add `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file in order to not leak your secrets.

```sh
npm i --save-dev dotenv
```

`.env` file
```
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJh...
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=wss://westus3.api.playwright-int.io/api/authorize/connectSession
```

## Add service configuration

Add the service configuration to your project in the same location as your existing Playwright config file. Use [playwright.service.config.ts](https://aka.ms/mpt/service-config) as a starting point:

```js
// playwright.service.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import config from './playwright.config';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// Name the test run if it's not named yet.
process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID = process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID || new Date().toISOString();

export default defineConfig(config, {
    // Define more generous timeout for the service operation if necessary.
    // timeout: 60000,
    // expect: {
    //   timeout: 10000,
    // },
    use: {
    connectOptions: {
      // Specify the service endpoint.
      wsEndpoint: `${process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL}?cap=${JSON.stringify({
        os: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_OS || 'linux',
        runId: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_RUN_ID
      })}`,
      timeout: 30000,
      headers: {
        'x-mpt-access-key': process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_ACCESS_TOKEN!
      },
      // Allow service to access the localhost.
      exposeNetwork: '<loopback>'
    }
  }
});
```

The service configuration serves to:
- Direct and authenticate Playwright to the Microsoft Playwright Testing service.
- Override timeouts for service operations, if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your project uses @playwright/test version 1.37 or above.

## Run the tests

Run Playwright tests against browsers managed by the service using the configuration you created above.

```sh
npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=20
```

## Next steps

- Experiment with different levels of parallelism. Learn more about how [parallelism](./docs/concept-understanding-parallelism.md) works with Playwright.

- Run tests in a [CI/CD pipeline.](./docs/configure-tests-with-ci-cd-pipeline.md)

- Learn how to [manage access](./docs/how-to-assign-roles.md) to the created workspace.

- Explore [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md) and [known issues](./docs/known-issues.md).
