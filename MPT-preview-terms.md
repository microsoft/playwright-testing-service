# MICROSOFT PLAYWRIGHT TESTING 


## 1. WHAT THE AGREEMENT COVERS 

This is an agreement between you (“you” or “your”) and Microsoft Corporation, (“Microsoft, “we,” “us” or “our”). The terms and conditions of this agreement (“agreement”) apply to your access and use of the Microsoft services preview features (the “Services”). The Services are optional evaluation services offered by Microsoft to select customers and partners to obtain feedback prior to general release. By accessing or using the Services, you accept the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not accept them, do not access or use the Services. If you are a subscriber of Microsoft Azure services, your Microsoft Azure customer agreement applies to your use of Microsoft Azure generally while this agreement applies to your use of the Services specifically. 

## 2. DATA 

You bear sole responsibility for any and all data provided to Microsoft through your access to or use of the Services (“Customer Data”), and any software programs or services you use in connection with your access to or use of the Services, including without limitation taking the steps necessary to back up such Customer Data, software programs or services. 

## 3. THE SERVICES 

### 3.1. Pre-Release Services and Updates. 

The Services provided under this agreement are in a pre-release stage and are only available for a limited time. The Services may not work correctly or the way a commercial version of the Services may function. The Services may experience interruptions and extended downtime during which you may not be able to access Customer Data or other functionality. Updates may be provided throughout the term and such updates may result in deleting the Customer Data or changing of Services functionality. In general, due to the pre-release nature of the Services, some or all of the Customer Data may be lost. Your Customer Data may not be migrated from the Services to any future pre-release or commercial versions that may be released. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using pre-release services and assume all risks associated with using the Services, including but not limited to risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations. 

### 3.2. Future Releases. 

Microsoft may change the Services at any time, including without limitation for a future pre-release or commercial version, and we may not release a future pre-release or commercial version. 

### 3.3. Pre-release Limitations 

Because of their pre-release status, the Services employ lesser or different privacy and security measures than those typically present in a Microsoft enterprise online service. You should not use the Services to process personal data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or other data that is subject to heightened compliance requirements. The Services or certain features of the Services may operate solely in the United States, and you agree that your Customer Data may be transferred, stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. 

### 3.4. Access and Use Rights. 

You may access and use the Services only through the means we designate for the Services and only in accordance with the terms of this agreement and the policies and procedures we designate for use of the Services. Subject to your acceptance and compliance with this agreement, you may use the Services for the sole purposes of testing the Services internally and providing feedback to Microsoft. 

### 3.5. Restrictions. 

In using the Services, you may not access or use the Services: 

* in a production or “live” operating environment; 

* to design or build a competitive service or to otherwise copy the design, functionality or user interfaces within the Services; 

* to work around any technical limitations in the Services that only allow you to use it in certain ways; 

* to share, publish, rent, lease, lend, sell or transfer the Services to any third party; or for commercial hosting services; 

* in a way prohibited by law, regulation, governmental order or decree; 

* to violate the rights of others; 

* to try to gain unauthorized access to or disrupt any service, device, data, account or network; 

* to spam or distribute malware; 

* in a way that could harm the Services or impair anyone else’s use of it; or 

* in any application or situation where failure of the Service could lead to the death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage. If you are using the Services in a shared or sandbox environment with other users who do not belong to your organization, you may not interfere with the use of the environment by other users and you may not access, delete, or modify any data, software, information or other materials placed in the environment by other users. 

## 4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

### 4.3. Your Use of the Customer Data. 

You represent, and agree to ensure, that you have the necessary rights to any Customer Data, software programs or services that you use in connection with the Services, and that such activities do not infringe the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any third party. You agree to obtain all necessary rights, and comply with all licenses or other terms, from the rightful owner of such Customer Data, software programs or services that you do not own.

During such periods, you may be unable to access or use all of, or a portion of, the Services. Some or all of the Customer Data may be lost. In the event of an outage or interruption that Microsoft determines may cause risk to the Services, Microsoft may determine in its sole discretion to suspend the Services. FOR THESE REASONS, THE SERVICES ARE EXCLUDED FROM ANY COMMITMENTS MICROSOFT MAKES IN ITS SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS GENERALLY. 

## 6. SOFTWARE 

If you receive software from us as part of the Services, your use of that software is under the terms of the license that is presented to you for acceptance for that software.

We reserve all other rights to such software. You may not disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any such software included in the Services, except and only to the extent that the law expressly permits this activity. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see https://www.microsoft.com/exporting. Unless we notify you otherwise, your license to use the software provided by us as part of the Services will end when your right to use the Services ends, and you must promptly uninstall the software. We may disable the software at this time. 

## 7. FEEDBACK 

If you give feedback about the Services to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share, and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any intellectual property rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
